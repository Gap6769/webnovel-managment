They are known as 'Hunters'. However, not all Hunters are powerful. My name is Sung Jin-Woo, an E-rank Hunter. I'm someone who has to risk his life in the lowliest of dungeons, the 'World's Weakest'. Having no skills whatsoever to display, I barely earned the required money by fighting in low-level dungeonsâ€¦ at least until I found a hidden dungeon with the hardest difficulty within the D-rank dungeons! In the end, as I was accepting death, I suddenly received a strange power, a quest log that only I could see, a secret to leveling up that only I know about! If I trained in accordance with my quests and hunted monsters, my level would rise. Changing from the weakest Hunter to the strongest S-rank Hunter!",

The wind carried the scent of ash and blood, remnants of the war that had finally come to an end.\n\n\"It's over,\" he whispered, more to himself than to Sylvie, who stood silently beside him.\n\nThe dragon-like companion nudged his hand gently with her snout. *Not over. Just beginning.*\n\nHe smiled faintly at her words echoing in his mind. She was right, as always. This wasn't an end, but a new beginning for Dicathen, for the people who had survived, and for himself.\n\n\"Arthur!\" a familiar voice called from behind.\n\nHe turned to see Tessia running toward him, her silver hair flowing behind her like a banner. Despite everything they had been through, she still managed to smile, and it was that smile that had kept him going through the darkest times.\n\n\"The council is gathering,\" she said as she reached him. \"They're waiting for you.\"\n\nArthur nodded, taking one last look at the horizon."
